# My Professional Portfolio!

## Features
Currently, it is very simple. I'll be adding a interactable timeline with all my experience/skills (kind of like a interactable resume).

The only feature right now is the JuanGPT, which is a LLM trained to answer questions based on my professional experience.

## Setup
Requires two ENV variables, both of which are set in the `stack.env`file
- `OPENAI_API_KEY = straight forward innit...`
- `ASSISTANT_ID = also straight forward innit???`
